# Libft
A project from the 42 curriculum to recreate a personal C library by reimplementing essential standard library functions and creating useful additional utilities.

My very first own library!

## üìö Project Description
**libft** is a custom C library that includes a wide range of fundamental functions, such as string manipulation, memory management, character checks, and linked list operations. This project is designed to deepen your understanding of C programming fundamentals including pointers, memory allocation, and low-level algorithm implementation.

## ‚úÖ Core Functions
Includes reimplementations of many standard C functions such as:
```bash
size_t  ft_strlen(const char *s);
void    *ft_memset(void *b, int c, size_t len);
char    *ft_strchr(const char *s, int c);
int     ft_isalpha(int c);
void    *ft_calloc(size_t count, size_t size);
char    *ft_strdup(const char *s1);
```
And many more for strings, memory, and character checks.

## Bonus Functions
Includes additional utilities such as:
```bash
typedef struct s_list
{
    void            *content;
    struct s_list   *next;
}               t_list;

t_list  *ft_lstnew(void *content);
void    ft_lstadd_front(t_list **lst, t_list *new);
int     ft_lstsize(t_list *lst);
void    ft_lstclear(t_list **lst, void (*del)(void *));
```
These functions handle singly linked lists and give you a solid foundation for working with dynamic data structures.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
- Each function mimics the behavior of the original standard function.
- Memory is managed manually using malloc, free, and write.
- Utility functions are modular and reusable.
- Code is written in C with strict adherence to 42 coding standards.

## üß† Concepts Learned
- Manual memory management (malloc, free).
- Pointer manipulation and string processing.
- Implementation of common C standard library functions.
- Linked list creation and management.
- Writing modular, reusable C code.
- Understanding and following coding standards.

## üìå Notes
- All functions were tested for correct behavior and edge cases.
- Make sure to handle memory leaks and invalid inputs carefully.
- The library serves as a foundation for many future 42 projects.

## üèÅ Bonus Objectives Achieved
‚úÖ Implemented linked list functions.
‚úÖ Created additional utility functions beyond the mandatory ones.
‚úÖ Ensured code quality and readability according to 42 standards.
‚úÖ Thoroughly tested functions for robustness.
